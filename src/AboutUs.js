            <h3> Our History! </h3> <br/>
            <h4> WHERE WE COME FROM </h4>

            <p>
            In 2003, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Mumbai, Maharashtra. They named it Pizza Hut because their sign only had room for eight letters. The restaurant's popularity grew quickly due to the delicious food and quality service. Today, there are more than 16,000 independently owned and operated Pizza Hut restaurants. Our 100+ franchise partners employ 350,000 team members in over 100 countries.

            <h3> Innovation </h3> <br/>
            <h4> Delivering The Future </h4> 

            <p>
            The Pizza Hut brand has a long history of firsts- the first national chain to offer online delivery ordering, the first pizza delivery to outer space, a world-record setting delivery to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro - and we're not slowing down any time soon. Pizza Hut is always looking for ways to innovate processes and deliver an even more exceptional service and product.
